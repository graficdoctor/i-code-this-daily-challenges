			'Where previous albums have been a melting pot of global influences, on their new LP African Head Charge have but one place in mind. »A Trip To Bolgatanga« is a musical journey to Bonjo’s current hometown in north Ghana. A psychedelic travelogue across the landscape featuring their trademark hand percussion and group chanting augmented with rumbling bass, mutated horns, dubbed out effects, wild wah-wah, haunted voodoo dancehall, synthetic swells, disco congas, tumbling layers of electronic effects, blues-inflected woodwind, and funky organ.',

Made of rarified material; it bends the contemporary “ambient” template into something almost entirely new, creating a blanket of pure atmosphere that wafts over you like a cloud, but which fully comes to life with closer, deep listening.",
